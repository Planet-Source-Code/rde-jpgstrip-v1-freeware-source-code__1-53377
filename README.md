</div>

### Description

This JPEG strip code is in response to a recent submission on JPEG info extraction. This code was developed by David Crowell using vb5, so don't vote. I posted it for those interested in learning more about the internals of the JPEG graphic format. Please follow Davids request to leave this zip archive intact if you re-distribute it. This is version 1, and David is still developing it, he has a freeware exe version 1.3 available at:

www.ksurf.net/~bermania/prog/dessin/jpgstrip.zip

I don't know whether sourse code is available.
